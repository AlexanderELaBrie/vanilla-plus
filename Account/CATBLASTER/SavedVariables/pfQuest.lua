Curious, I pushed one of them to see what would happen, and it was a trap! I nearly fell to my death from the explosion. Laying there on the ledge, I looked down and noticed that there was another statue at the base of the room; an altar of sorts...

I have a couple ideas where to start looking; I have high hopes that soon, we'll be asking you to head out and recover them.\n\nThe High Explorer needs to be informed on this, Naimah; no doubt, he also wants to thank you personally for once again aiding the League."] = {
